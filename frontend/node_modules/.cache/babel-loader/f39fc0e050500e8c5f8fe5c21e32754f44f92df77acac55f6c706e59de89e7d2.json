Unlike cavities caused by bacteria, erosion is the result of acids directly dissolving the enamel. Common sources include acidic foods and beverages, as well as conditions like acid reflux. Over time, erosion can lead to sensitivity, discoloration, and an increased risk of cavities. Preventive measures include reducing acidic intake and maintaining good oral hygiene. An image of dental erosion would show smooth, shiny areas on the tooth surface where enamel has been worn away, often exposing the underlying dentin.\",\r\n      image: \"path/to/image7.jpg\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      code: \"k0008\",\r\n      name: \"Gingivitis\",\r\n      description: \"Gingivitis is the mildest form of gum disease, causing irritation, redness, and swelling of the gums due to plaque buildup. If left untreated, gingivitis can progress to more severe periodontal diseases. The main symptoms include red, swollen gums that may bleed easily when brushing or flossing. Maintaining good oral hygiene and regular dental check-ups are essential for preventing and treating gingivitis.
